# twitter-unfollower - unfollow who do not follow you back on twitter


 Twitter-unfollower contains 2 files: keys.py and unfollow.py. It uses Tweepy API (python twitter API wrapper) to unfollow people that do not follow you back. Here is the docs for the API: http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/index.html

 UPDATE: You can also unfollow people that do not have profile pictures.

 WIP.
